        <div class="subheading mb-5">Undeclared Student</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My complete name is Jaqueline Patricia Torres Martinez. I was born in Central America, in El Salvador. I came to United States in October 2018, when I was sixteen years old. I came with my mother, my little sister and my little bother. I learned English in the High School where I could graduate with honors. In adition, during my time in High School I was working and studying at the same time which was not easy but I had to do it because my mother needed my help. Actually, I am twenty years old. I am studying on the University of California Riverside. My major still undeclared but I plan to study Political Science. I no longer live with my mom and thank God she is financially stable. My brothers are studying in middle school and when I can I visit them, I help them with their homework and we go to the park. In the future I want to achieve my goal as graduate from the University. I want to always follow my dreams and don't give up.<br><br>

        My first work experience was when I was young. A lady had hired me to help her with her mini restaurant in the city where we lived. I knew little about cooking and with her I learned to be different dishes from desserts to soups. I worked there in the mornings and in the afternoons I went to study. Every day I learned something new and when I had learned enough, the lady just told me that she wanted me to prepare her and I did it for her while she served. Work with her up to a month before traveling to the United States. That experience was not so professional but it taught me a lot and I'm not just talking about cooking. That experience taught me to value money, to be responsible, to set a goal and not rest until I achieve it.
        
        My second work experience was in a factory where there were asian products. The place was like a large supermarket where I had to scan the products and collect them as they came out in the order. In this job I went from aisle to aisle picking up the products but in the middle of my shift they put me to pack. That is to say that someone else was still scanning the products and I was packing them. For me packing was much more difficult but every time I got more practice because I didn't like to give up. That job was a lot of fun but unfortunately I had to quit because whoever was taking me could no longer take me and at that time I didn't have a car and my mom couldn't take me because she had to go work somewhere else.
        
        And finally my most recent job was in a restaurant where they sold hamburgers, Mexican food and American breakfast. In that restaurant I had many responsibilities such as taking orders in person and over the phone. Clean tables, sweep and mop. She also served food to customers in the morning and learned how to take orders through the drive thru. In short, in that job I had many responsibilities and I liked being in that environment. Everyone was nice to me and I learned much more about food than I knew. I learned to make hamburgers and much more.
        
        What I have liked about every job I have had is that each one of them has taught me new things and has made me see that learning never stops. I liked learning to cook and knowing about different types of food. I liked learning to pack and learn about products from other countries.
